# Image_To_ASCII_Art
Converting Image to ASCII Art 

The project uses pywhatkit module of python and converts an image to its corresponding ASCII art.
The source image can be changed. Here in this code I have used an image of a star.
The star.png gets converted to its corresponding ASCII art and saves it in a .text file in the same folder by default.
